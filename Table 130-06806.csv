Note(s):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Statistics on the latest population and household characteristics are primarily based on data collected in the General Household Survey (GHS) in January to December of the year. They may be regarded as referring to the average situation of the whole year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GHS covers the land-based non-institutional population and thus does not cover (a) inmates of institutions; and (b) persons living on board vessels. The land-based non-institutional population constitutes about 99% of the Hong Kong Resident Population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Median monthly household income are rounded to the nearest hundred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 Domestic household consists of a group of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. Households comprising only non-Hong Kong residents or Mobile Residents are not classified as domestic households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 Household size refers to the number of household members in a domestic household.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Monthly household income refers to the total cash income, including earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs and other cash income received in the month before enumeration by all members of the household. Other cash income includes income generated from rent income, interest, dividends, regular/monthly pensions and insurance annuity benefits, regular contribution from persons outside the household, regular contribution from charities and all government subsidies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 Economically active household is a domestic household with at least one member (excluding foreign domestic helpers) being economically active.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 The boundaries of the Wan Chai district and Eastern district adopted since 2016 are different from those adopted in 2015 and earlier years. Therefore, figures of the Wan Chai and Eastern districts for 2016 and thereafter are not strictly comparable with those for 2015 and earlier years in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
